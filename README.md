# SvumpeSkriptet
This repo contains all code for my (mushroom) incubator, which measures temperature and humidity, sends alerts to my phone, and controls fans to optimise humidity.

This Arduino-based incubator relies on the Nano ESP32-S3R8 IoT, and uses the DHT22 AM2302as temperature- and humidity sensor, while displaying measured values on a 2.42T I2C OLED display. Two fans are applied for controlling humidity.
